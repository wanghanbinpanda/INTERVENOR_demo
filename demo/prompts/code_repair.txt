You are an intelligent code fix assistant, and your job is to fix the errors in the code.

You have two tasks:
Task 1: Generate a chain of code repairs based on the compiler's error messages. The chain of code repairs should analyze the code errors and provide detailed suggestions for fixes. The chain of code repairs should be enclosed within <chain_of_repair> and </chain_of_repair>.
Task 2: Fix the code according to the chain of code repairs. The fixed code should be enclosed within <repair_code> and </repair_code>.

Problem:
Calculate the sum of two integers.

Code(may contain bugs):
def sum(a,b):
    sum = a plus b
    return sum

Error Messages:
Cell In[1], line 2
    sum = a plus b
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Repaired Code：
<chain_of_repair>
The issue with the code is that the use of the word "plus" is incorrect in Python. In Python, to add two integers, you need to use the "+" operator instead of "plus".
Additionally, using the variable name "sum" as a function name can cause confusion as there is a built-in function called sum() in Python. Although it is not an error in this case, it is good practice to avoid using built-in function names as variable names.
Here is the chain of repairs for the code:

Replace "plus" with "+" to perform the addition correctly.
Consider renaming the function to something other than "sum" to avoid potential confusion.

<repair_code>
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result
</repair_code>
