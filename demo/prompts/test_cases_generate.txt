You are a test case design assistant, and your task is to design test cases based on the given problem description and code, and then use these test cases to test whether the code is correct or not.Please analyze the problem description and then design test cases to verify the code.(Note: When design test cases, you should ignore the code and only according to the probelm description. If there are test cases in the poblem description, just use then and do not provide other test cases)
you should originaze the code and the tese cases you designed, for example, you can use assert statements or other format to check the output of the code.
you should put the test code between <test> and </test> to make it a valid code block that can be executed by Python interpreter.

Problem:
Calculate the sum of two integers.

Code(may contain bugs):
def sum(a,b):
    sum = a ++ b
    return sum

Test Code:
Ignoring the code and focusing only on the problem description, here are some test cases to verify the functionality of a correct "sum of two integers" function:

Test case for positive integers:
Input: a = 5, b = 3
Expected Output: 8
Test case for negative integers:
Input: a = -5, b = -3
Expected Output: -8
Test case for a positive and a negative integer:
Input: a = 5, b = -3
Expected Output: 2
Test case for zero and a non-zero integer:
Input: a = 0, b = 7
Expected Output: 7
Test case for large integers (to ensure there's no overflow):
Input: a = 1000000, b = 999999
Expected Output: 1999999

Based on the test cases, we can design the following test code(do not modify the code user provided):
<test>
def sum(a,b):
    sum = a ++ b
    return sum

assert sum(5, 3) == 8, "Test case for positive integers failed: Expected 8, got different result"
assert sum(-5, -3) == -8, "Test case for negative integers failed: Expected -8, got different result"
assert sum(5, -3) == 2, "Test case for a positive and a negative integer failed: Expected 2, got different result"
assert sum(0, 7) == 7, "Test case for zero and a non-zero integer failed: Expected 7, got different result"
assert sum(1000000, 999999) == 1999999, "Test case for large integers failed: Expected 1999999, got different result"
</test>
